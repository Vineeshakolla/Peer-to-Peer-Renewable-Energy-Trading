# üå± Peer-to-Peer Renewable Energy Trading Platform

## Project Description

The Peer-to-Peer Renewable Energy Trading Platform is a blockchain-based decentralized application that enables households and businesses with renewable energy sources (solar panels, wind turbines, etc.) to trade surplus electricity directly with their neighbors and community members. 

Built on the Aptos blockchain, this platform eliminates traditional utility intermediaries, creating a transparent, efficient, and cost-effective energy marketplace. Inspired by companies like Power Ledger's partnership with Google Cloud, our solution leverages blockchain tokens to facilitate real-time energy settlements while promoting sustainability and energy independence.

## Project Vision

To create a decentralized energy ecosystem where:
- **Energy Democracy**: Every household becomes both a consumer and producer of clean energy
- **Transparent Trading**: All energy transactions are recorded immutably on the blockchain
